Since then, the open-source AI ecosystem has grown a lot, with smaller, domain-specific models achieving impressive results—it’s the case for IBM’s Granite, Ai2’s Olmo 3 and, of course, DeepSeek’s models. Anthony Annunziata, Director of Open Source AI at IBM and the AI Alliance, sees this trend accelerating in 2026.\\n\\n“We’re going to see smaller reasoning models that are multimodal and easier to tune for specific domains,” he said during an interview with IBM Think. [...] After much skepticism around AI’s ROI, AI capabilities will pave new ways to do business in the enterprise. And open-source reasoning models and agents will keep pushing boundaries to conquer enterprise AI.\\n\\nAt the same time, trust and security will become key priorities as many enterprises sharpen their focus on AI sovereignty.\\n\\nThat’s just the opening act for what’s to come in enterprise tech in the days ahead. Read on for 18 expert predictions to watch out for in 2026.\\n\\nIndustry newsletter\\n\\n### The latest AI trends, brought to you by experts\\n\\nGet curated insights on the most important—and intriguing—AI news.

[...] “2026 is when these patterns are going to come out of the lab and into real life,” said Blair, who leads IBM’s BeeAI and Agent Stack initiatives. Both projects were contributed to the Linux Foundation.\\n\\nThe Linux Foundation recently announced the formation of the Agentic AI Foundation and Anthropic’s contribution of MCP. “We’re excited that MCP has come under open governance,” Blair said. “Openly governed, community standards are what is going to unlock more creativity, more innovation and more solutions.”\\n\\nThe A2A project is about to hit its first major release. “We’re already seeing collaboration between A2A and MCP to standardize on a single card to describe an entity, whether it’s a tool or resource in MCP or an agent in A2A,” she said.\", \"score\": 0.9695556}, {\"title\": \"AI News | Latest News | Insights Powering AI-Driven Business Growth\", \"url\": \"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/\", \"content\": \"Retail & Logistics AI\\n\\nJanuary 12, 2026\\n\\n### L’Oréal brings AI into everyday digital advertising production\\n\\nAI in Action\\n\\nJanuary 5, 2026\\n\\n#### Industries\\n\\n### Grab brings robotics in-house to manage delivery costs\\n\\nAI Mergers & Acquisitions\\n\\nJanuary 7, 2026\\n\\n### The Law Society: Current laws are fit for the AI era\\n\\nLegal Industry AI\\n\\nJanuary 6, 2026\\n\\n### L’Oréal brings AI into everyday digital advertising production\\n\\nAI in Action\\n\\nJanuary 5, 2026\\n\\n#### Deep Learning\\n\\n### IBM Research unveils breakthrough analog AI chip for efficient deep learning\\n\\nAI Market Trends\\n\\nAugust 11, 2023\\n\\n### Damian Bogunowicz, Neural Magic: On revolutionising deep learning with CPUs\\n\\nAI Market Trends\\n\\nJuly 24, 2023\\n\\n### OpenAI’s GPT-3 is a convincing philosopher\\n\\nAI Market Trends\\n\\nJuly 27, 2022\\n\\n## Subscribe [...] AI Market Trends\\n\\nJuly 27, 2022\\n\\n## Subscribe\\n\\nAll our premium content and latest tech news delivered straight to your inbox\\n\\n## Resources\\n\\nResource\\n\\nJanuary 8, 2026\\n\\n# On-Demand Webinar: AI Combined with Automation is the Perfect Marriage for Scalable, Intelligent Operations\\n\\nResource\\n\\nJanuary 6, 2026\\n\\n# On-Demand Webinar: DataOps Can Build the Foundation For Your Generative AI Ambitions\\n\\nResource\\n\\nDecember 11, 2025\\n\\n# On-Demand Webinar: From Complexity to Clarity: AI + Agility Layer for Intelligent Insurance\\n\\nResource\\n\\nDecember 11, 2025\\n\\n# On-Demand Webinar: Turning a Hacker’s Toolkit Against Them\\n\\nResource\\n\\nDecember 11, 2025\\n\\n# On-Demand Webinar: CMS Buyer’s Briefing: A Live Look at What’s Next in AI-Driven Platforms\\n\\nResource\\n\\nDecember 11, 2025 [...] Internet of Things News\\n\\nJanuary 13, 2026\\n\\n## Juniper Research releases emerging IoT trends report for 2026\\n\\nTelecoms Tech News\\n\\nJanuary 12, 2026\\n\\n## How AI-RAN delivers operational ROI for telcos\\n\\nAI News\\n\\nJanuary 13, 2026\\n\\n## Allister Frost: Tackling workforce anxiety for AI integration success\\n\\nMarketing Tech News\\n\\nJanuary 13, 2026\\n\\n## Inside Google’s push to blend AI chat and online shopping\\n\\nTelecoms Tech News\\n\\nJanuary 13, 2026\\n\\n## Asia’s telecom operators try to grow without relying on data plans\\n\\n## Subscribe\\n\\nAll our premium content and latest tech news delivered straight to your inbox\\n\\n## Explore\\n\\n## Reach Our Audience\\n\\n## Categories\\n\\n## Other Publications\\n\\nAI News is part of TechForge\\n\\n## Subscribe\\n\\nAll our premium content and latest tech news delivered straight to your inbox\", \"score\": 0.9635062}, {\"title\": \"AI News & Artificial Intelligence | TechCrunch\", \"url\": \"https://techcrunch.com/category/artificial-intelligence/\", \"content\": \"### Topics\\n\\nLatest\\n\\nAI\\n\\nAmazon\\n\\nApps\\n\\nBiotech & Health\\n\\nClimate\\n\\nCloud Computing\\n\\nCommerce\\n\\nCrypto\\n\\nEnterprise\\n\\nEVs\\n\\nFintech\\n\\nFundraising\\n\\nGadgets\\n\\nGaming\\n\\nGoogle\\n\\nGovernment & Policy\\n\\nHardware\\n\\nInstagram\\n\\nLayoffs\\n\\nMedia & Entertainment\\n\\nMeta\\n\\nMicrosoft\\n\\nPrivacy\\n\\nRobotics\\n\\nSecurity\\n\\nSocial\\n\\nSpace\\n\\nStartups\\n\\nTikTok\\n\\nTransportation\\n\\nVenture\\n\\n### More from TechCrunch\\n\\nStaff\\n\\nEvents\\n\\nStartup Battlefield\\n\\nStrictlyVC\\n\\nNewsletters\\n\\nPodcasts\\n\\nVideos\\n\\nPartner Content\\n\\nTechCrunch Brand Studio\\n\\nCrunchboard\\n\\nContact Us\\n\\n# AI [...] TechCrunch Brand Studio\\n\\nCrunchboard\\n\\nContact Us\\n\\n# AI\\n\\nNews coverage on artificial intelligence and machine learning tech, the companies building them, and the ethical issues AI raises today.

[...] The iPhone maker will obviously benefit from giving users a much more capable Siri, as well as other AI features, at an attractive cost and while guaranteeing user privacy. Dan Ives, an equity analyst who covers Apple for Wedbush, said in a note the deal provided Apple with “a stepping stone to accelerate its AI strategy into 2026 and beyond.”  \\n  \\nBut Apple’s continuing need to rely on partners—first OpenAI and now Google—to deliver these AI features is a worrisome sign, suggesting that Apple, a champion of vertical integration, is still struggling to build its own LLM. [...] It’s a problem that has dogged the company since the beginning of the generative AI era: For months last year several Apple Intelligence features were delayed, and the long-awaited debut of an updated Siri has been pushed back numerous times. These delays have taken a toll on Apple’s reputation as a tech leader and angered customers, some of whom filed a class action lawsuit against the company after the AI features promoted in ads for the iPhone 16 weren’t initially available on the device.\\n\\nWhen Apple CEO Tim Cook promised an updated version of Siri would be released in 2026, many assumed it would be powered by Apple’s own AI models.
